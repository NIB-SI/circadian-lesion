# Installation OpenCV under Linux

At https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html you can find very detailed instructions and additional packeges etc. It is recommended to carry out the following steps to have a quick start with OpenCV.

## Required Packages

The packages can be installed using a terminal and the following commands:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev

## Download OpenCV version 3.1.0

download and unzip the source archives at desired location e. g. /home/user/OpenCV

https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/3.1.0
https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/releases/tag/3.1.0

## Building OpenCV from Source Using CMake

1. Create a temporary directory, which we denote as <cmake_build_dir>, where you want to put the generated Makefiles, project files as well the object files and output binaries and enter there.
       cd home/jule/OpenCV/opencv-3.1.0
       mkdir build
       cd build
       
2. Configuring. Run cmake [<some optional parameters>] <path to the OpenCV source directory>
       cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH='/home/user/OpenCV/opencv_contrib-3.1.0/modules/' -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
       
       Note: Use cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .. , without spaces after -D if the above example doesn't work
       
3. Build. From build directory execute make, it is recommended to do this in several threads
       make -j7 # runs 7 jobs in parallel
       
4. To install libraries, execute the following command from build directory
       sudo make install
